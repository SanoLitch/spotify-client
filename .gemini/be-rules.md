You are a senior TypeScript programmer with experience in the NestJS framework
and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic
principles and nomenclature.

## TypeScript General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and Russian for documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return
  value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Use access modifiers for class members explicit (except constructors).
- Use method/function return type explicit.
- One export per file.

### Architecture

- Use Hexagon, Clean architecture and Domain Driven Design principles.
- Use vertical slice approach based on feature/entity for modules.
- Use next folder structure for each module/slice:
  - _api_ contains controller, DTOs and other api/presentation stuff.
  - _ext_ contains external integrations grouped by feature (e.g., _spotify_, _storage_).
    - Each subfolder in _ext_ should contain its own port definitions and adapters.
  - _domain_ contains domain entities, use-cases and business logic.
  - _lib_ contains mappers, utility and etc.
- Incapsulate buissness logic in domain entities/services
- Use repository pattern for storage models
- Use "port" suffix for interfaces and "adapter" for implementations (e.g., `AuthPort`, `SpotifyAuthAdapter`).
- Move shared DDD objects (Value Objects like Email, base classes) to `@libs/ddd`.
- Module _storage_ in _src/ext/storage_ contains base functionality to interact with database:
  - folder _migrations_ used for migration storing
  - folder _schemes_ contains all PrismaORM schemes, one file per entity

# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Common Principles

## General Principles:

- Thin Services, Rich Domain: Services in the domain layer should act as
  orchestrators (Application Services). They coordinate the workflow but do not
  contain business logic. All business rules, validations, and logic should be
  encapsulated within Domain Entities and Value Objects.
- Separation of Concerns: Strictly separate layers. The api layer communicates
  with the domain layer via DTOs. The domain layer is self-contained. The db
  layer (Repositories) communicates with the database and should be
  persistence-ignorant from the domain's perspective.
- Explicit Dependencies: The domain layer should have no dependencies on
  external frameworks or libraries (like NestJS, Express, or even
  database-specific libraries like Prisma Client). All external interactions
  should be handled at the application's boundaries (services, controllers,
  mappers).

## Domain Entities:

- Identity and Mutability: An entity has a unique identity (id) that remains
  constant throughout its lifecycle. Its other properties can be mutable.
- Encapsulation: An entity is responsible for maintaining its own invariants
  (business rules that must always be true). Its internal state should only be
  modified through its own methods, never directly from a service.
- Factory Methods for Creation: Use static factory methods (e.g., static
  create(...)) to construct new entity instances. This method should encapsulate
  all the logic for creating a valid entity, including:
  - Generating a unique ID (Uuid.create()).
  - Hashing passwords (PasswordHash.create(...)).
  - Setting default values (e.g., createdAt). -Validating input parameters.
- Business Logic in Methods: All operations that change or query the state of an
  entity should be implemented as methods on the entity itself (e.g.,
  isPasswordMatching(...), updateProfile(...), deactivate()).

## Value Objects (VOs)

- No Identity: A Value Object is defined by its attributes, not by an ID. Two
  VOs with the same attributes are considered equal.
- Immutability: A Value Object must be immutable. Once created, its state cannot
  be changed. If a change is needed, a new instance of the VO should be created.
  All properties should be readonly.
- Encapsulation of Primitives: Use VOs to wrap primitive types (string, number)
  that have business meaning. This prevents "Primitive Obsession" and makes the
  domain model more expressive.
  - string for a password hash -> PasswordHash VO.
  - string for a UUID -> Uuid VO.
  - string for an email -> Email VO.
- Self-Validation: A VO should validate its own value upon creation in its
  constructor or a factory method. It should be impossible to create an invalid
  VO.

## Repositories

- Persistence Ignorance: Repositories are the boundary between the domain and
  the data access layer. They should present an interface that feels like an
  in-memory collection.
- Return Persistence Models: Repositories should accept and return "raw"
  persistence models (e.g., Prisma models), not domain entities. The
  responsibility for mapping between persistence models and domain entities lies
  with the Application Service (or a dedicated Mapper called by the service).
- Fail-Fast: Prefer methods that throw an exception when an item is not found
  (e.g., findUniqueOrThrow) over methods that return null. This simplifies the
  service layer by centralizing error handling.

## Mappers

- Single Responsibility: A mapper's only job is to translate data between
  layers.
- Clear Method Naming: Use explicit names for mapping methods:
- toEntity(persistenceModel): DomainEntity (or toDomain)
- toDto(domainEntity): DTO
- toPersistence(domainEntity): PersistenceModel
- Hydration/Dehydration: The mapper is responsible for "hydrating" Value Objects
  from primitive types when mapping toEntity, and "dehydrating" them back to
  primitives when mapping toPersistence or toDto.

# Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Rich Model & Aggregates Principles

This document outlines the core principles for implementing a rich domain model
using the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. The primary goal is to move
beyond anemic domain models (where objects are just data containers) and create
"smart" entities that encapsulate business logic and rules, leading to a more
robust, maintainable, and understandable system.

---

## 1. The Aggregate Pattern

- An **Aggregate** is a cluster of associated objects (entities and value
  objects) that we treat as a single unit for the purpose of data changes.
- Every Aggregate has a single entry point called the **Aggregate Root**. It is
  a specific entity within the aggregate.
- All external references must only go to the Aggregate Root. Child entities
  within the aggregate can only be accessed through the root.
- A change to any object within the aggregate boundary must be performed as a
  single, atomic transaction.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "GameSession Aggregate"
        A[GameSession <br/> (Aggregate Root)] --> B(Player)
        A --> C(Map)
        B --> D(Building)
        B --> E(Unit)
    end
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

---

## 2. Responsibilities of an Aggregate Root

The Aggregate Root is the heart of the pattern. It must be responsible for the
following:

- **Be the Sole Gatekeeper:** All commands and modifications for any entity
  within the aggregate must go through a method on the Aggregate Root. Direct
  modification of child entities from services is forbidden.
- **Enforce Invariants:** The Aggregate Root is responsible for maintaining the
  consistency and validity of the entire aggregate. It must enforce all business
  rules (invariants) before any state change is committed.
  > _Example: A `GameSession` root must ensure a `Player` cannot be added if the
  > session is already `IN_PROGRESS`._
- **Manage Entity Lifecycles:** The Aggregate Root controls the creation and
  deletion of its child entities.
  > _Example: A `GameSession` creates `Player`s; a `Player` creates
  > `Building`s._
- **Use Factory Methods for Creation:** Use static factory methods (e.g.,
  `static createNew()`) to encapsulate the logic for creating a valid root
  instance in its initial state.
- **Expose Behavior, Not State:** Methods on the root should be named after
  business operations (e.g., `addPlayer`, `startGame`, `finishGame`), not
  generic setters (e.g., `setStatus`).

---

## 3. Responsibilities of Child Entities

- **Contain Local Logic:** Entities within the aggregate should contain business
  logic that pertains directly to them.
  > _Example: A `Building` entity should know how to `produceUnit()`._
- **Never Be Modified Directly:** Their state should only be changed by methods
  on the Aggregate Root or by other entities within the same aggregate.

---

## 4. The Role of Application Services (Use Cases)

- **Be Thin Orchestrators:** Services should not contain business logic. Their
  role is to orchestrate the interaction between the outside world (e.g.,
  controllers) and the domain model.
- **Follow a Clear Workflow:**
  1.  **Fetch:** Load one or more Aggregate Roots from the repository.
  2.  **Execute:** Call a single method on an Aggregate Root, passing any
      necessary data. The domain model handles all the business rules.
  3.  **Persist:** Save the modified Aggregate Root back to the repository.
- **Manage Transactions:** The service is responsible for defining the
  transaction boundary. The entire `fetch -> execute -> persist` flow should be
  atomic.

---

## 5. Example: Anemic vs. Rich Model

### Before: Anemic Model (Logic in the Service)

```typescript
// In PlayerService.ts
async addPlayerToSession(userId: string, sessionId: string): Promise<void> {
  const session = await this.sessionRepo.findById(sessionId);
  const playerExists = await this.playerRepo.exists(userId, sessionId);

  if (session.status !== 'WAITING') {
    throw new SessionNotWaitingError();
  }
  if (playerExists) {
    throw new PlayerAlreadyJoinedError();
  }
  // ... more checks ...

  const player = new Player({ userId, sessionId, ... }); // Just a data bag
  await this.playerRepo.save(player);

  session.playerCount++; // Direct state mutation
  await this.sessionRepo.save(session);
}
```

### After: Rich Model (Logic in the Domain Model)

```typescript
// In GameSessionService.ts
async addPlayerToSession(userId: string, sessionId: string): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Fetch the aggregate root
  const session = await this.sessionRepo.findById(sessionId);
  const user = await this.userRepo.findById(userId);

  // 2. Execute a business method on the root. All logic is inside.
  session.addPlayer(user);

  // 3. Persist the entire aggregate
  await this.sessionRepo.save(session);
}

// In GameSession.ts (The Aggregate Root)
public addPlayer(user: User): void {
  if (this.status !== GameSessionStatus.Waiting) {
    throw new SessionNotWaitingError();
  }
  if (this.players.some(p => p.userId.equals(user.id))) {
    throw new PlayerAlreadyJoinedError();
  }
  // ... more checks ...

  const newPlayer = Player.createForSession(user, this.id);
  this.players.push(newPlayer);
}
```

---

## 6. Benefits of This Approach

- **Robustness:** Business rules are consistently enforced because they are
  co-located with the data they protect. It becomes impossible to create an
  invalid state.
- **Testability:** The rich domain model can be unit-tested in complete
  isolation, without databases, frameworks, or external dependencies.
- **Clarity:** The code becomes a more accurate reflection of the business
  domain. The intent of a use case is immediately clear from reading the service
  method.
- **Flexibility:** Services become simple "glue" code and are easy to change or
  replace without affecting the core business logic encapsulated in the domain
  model.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, methods.
- Use camelCase for class/interface/type/object/etc member names
  - Except if another naming provided by documentation.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use kebab-case for file migration file names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Use PascalCase for PrismaORM model name, use singular form.
  - Force provide "@@map" attribute with snake_case name, use plural form of the
    same name.
  - Use snake_case for enititi's field name in PrismaORM models
    - If name has underscore then force provide "map" attribute with same value
      as field/table name, but use camelCase format
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters
- Try to use closet relative path within one module for imports
- Group imports by:
  - Platform specific imports should be at the top
  - After third-party modules
  - After project files
- Sort each import group by:
  - Distance to target file
  - Alphabetical
- Use Public Api methodology for re-export module members outside by using
  index.ts file

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function
  nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to NestJS

### Basic Principles

- Use modular architecture
- Encapsulate the API in modules.
  - One module per main domain/route.
  - One controller for its route.
    - And other controllers for secondary routes.
  - A models folder with data types.
    - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
    - Declare simple types for outputs.
  - A services module with business logic and persistence.
    - Entities with PrismaORM for data persistence.
    - One service per entity.
- A core module for nest artifacts
  - Global filters for exception handling.
  - Global middlewares for request management.
  - Guards for permission management.
  - Interceptors for request management.
- A shared module for services shared between modules.
  - Utilities
  - Shared business logic

### Testing

- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.
- Write tests for each controller and service.
- Write end to end tests for each api module.
